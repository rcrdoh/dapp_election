# dapp_election

Here is the Election Dapp based on a cryptokitties Dapp.

This Dapp looks to work in the Ethereum network , but for now it just works on ganache(private custom network), registering the votes of every voter and put it to the appropriate candidate.

Also it contains an interface in HTML and javascript , used in the truffle framework for dapps.
