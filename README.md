# dapp_election

Here is election Dapp based on a cryptokitties Dapp.

This is Dapp looks to work in Ethereum network , but for now it just works on ganache(private custom network), registering the votes of every voter and put it to the appropriate candidate.

Also it has a interface in HTML and javascript , used in the truffle framework for dapps.
